# 6-button_midi_foot_controller
6-button midi controller for Line6 Helix guitar/bass fx-unit

Made for my own guitar playing hobby to select different sounds from midi-controllable fx-unit.
This is a full DIY project. Enclosure is some Hammond diecast aluminium case. Buttons are some momentary switches. Connectors are made by neutrik as always in my projects. Great stuff.

Unit is not fully scomplete yet. It was ready enough to be taken to use but some functions haven't get from plans to the code. Maybe some day.
